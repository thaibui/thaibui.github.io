# 2016 is a year for bloggers

My name is Thai Bui and welcome to my personal blog. 

I am currently a software engineer at Bazaarvoice, Inc., the San Francisco
office. As part of my job, I have to write code every day so I like to be able
to write my blog as if I am writing code. Fortunately, I am not the only one who
wanted this.

### Setting up the blog

I have never blogged before, nor have I ever set up a personal blog so creating
this blog is very exciting. I knew that I would want to use [Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) since it is a simple and free web hosting
service by Github, plus you get to write the blog in
[Markdown](http://markdownlivepreview.com/). The idea of having your blog as a
Github project is just convenient and attractive. It allows you to edit your
posts in a terminal, in your favorite IDEs or directly from your phones using
Github's already remarkable web interface.

As satisfied as I am with Github's hosting service and its many options for
editing, I still need to find a tool to help me create all the web pages and
manage the features that a blog would normally have such as tagging,
commenting, theming and personalizing. For that, the default funciontalities of
Gihub Pages are just too lacking so I needed something a bit more advanced.
Luckily, Github Pages uses a quite sofisticated tool called
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) under the hood to render Markdown content into
HTML, and there goes my journey to install and learn all of the great things (or
not) about Jekyll.

### Learning a new tool

First off, I'm impressed with how easy it is to jump start a blog using Jekyll.
I've created this blog in under a day or two from the moment I
looked at Jekyll to the moment I've published the initial [draft] [first_post]
online. That includes setting up Jekyll locally, finding a theme I [like]
[so_simple_theme], customizing the theme to my [tastes] [design_seeds], creating
a custom [homepage layout] [homepage_layout], configuring Disqus, Google
Analytics, verifing website ownership to Google search engine and oh, so much 
more. Jekyll + the theme I chose really makes things easy. 

Though, I have to admit that I've had help from my girlfriend who made the
awesome [favicon] [favicon] for this blog using her phone. Yes, you are reading it
correctly, from her phone! She was super fast too, having it done in 10 minutes
while I was wrangling with Inkscape and the likes.
