# 2016 is a year for bloggers

My name is Thai Bui and welcome to my personal blog. 

I am currently a software engineer at Bazaarvoice, Inc., the San Francisco
office. As part of my job, I have to write code every day so I like to be able
to write my blog as if I am writing code. Fortunately, I am not the only one who
wanted this.

### Setting up the blog

I have never blogged before, nor have I ever set up a personal blog so creating
this blog is very exciting. I knew that I would want to use [Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com/){:target="_blank"} since it is a simple and
free web hosting service by Github, plus you get to write the blog in
[Markdown](http://markdownlivepreview.com/){:target="_blank"}. 

The idea of having your blog as a Github project is just convenient and
attractive. It allows you to edit your posts in a terminal, in your favorite
IDEs or directly from your phones using Github's familiar web
interface.

Still, I need to find a tool to help me create all the web pages and manage the
features that a blog would normally have such as tagging, commenting, theming
and personalizing. For that, the default functionalities of Github Pages are just
too lacking so I needed something a bit more advanced.  Luckily, Github Pages
uses a quite sophisticated tool called
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank"} under the hood to render
Markdown content into HTML. There goes my journey to install and learn all about
Jekyll.

### Learning a new tool

First off, I'm impressed with how easy it is to jump-start a blog using Jekyll.
I created this blog in under a day or two from the moment I've
looked at Jekyll to the moment the first initial [draft] [first_post]{:target="_blank"}
was published. That includes setting up Jekyll locally, finding a theme I [like]
[so_simple_theme]{:target="_blank"}, customizing the colors to my [tastes]
[design_seeds]{:target="_blank"}, making the latest post to always be on the
[homepage] [homepage_layout]{:target="_blank"}, configuring Disqus, Google
Analytics, verifying website ownership to the search engine and so much more.
Jekyll + the theme I chose really makes things easy. 

Though, I have to admit that I've had help from my girlfriend who made the
awesome [favicon] [favicon]{:target="_blank"} for this blog using her phone.
Yes, you are reading it correctly, from her phone! She was super fast too,
having it done in 10 minutes while I was wrangling with Inkscape and the likes.

### Starting a new thing

I started this blog because I miss writing a lot. Despite being able to write
code every day, I don't get many opportunities to write down things that need a
story. Coding just doesn't have the same invigorating feelings as crafting a
nice story does. 

I also wanted to use this blog as a place to share ideas. I think good ideas
only come ever so often, but without sharing, you'll never know if they are
actually good. It's such a waste to throw away good ideas, so even if most of
them are useless I will try to spit them all out. Perhaps, once a week, I hope.
