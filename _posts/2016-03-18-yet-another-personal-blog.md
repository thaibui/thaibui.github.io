# 2016 is a year for bloggers

My name is Thai Bui and welcome to my personal blog. 

I am currently a software engineer at Bazaarvoice, Inc., the San Francisco
office. As part of my job, I have to write code every day so I like to be able
to write my blog as if I am writing code. Fortunately, I am not the only one who
wanted this.

### Setting up the blog

I have never blogged before, nor have I ever set up a personal blog so creating
this blog is very exciting. I knew that I would want to use [Github
Pages](https://pages.github.com/) since it is a simple and free web hosting
service by Github, plus you get to write the blog in
[Markdown](http://markdownlivepreview.com/). The idea of having your blog as a
Github project is just convenient and attractive. It allows you to edit your
posts in a terminal, in your favorite IDE or directly from your phone using
Github's already remarkable web interface.

As satisfied as I am with Github's hosting service and its many options for
editing, I still need to find a tool to help me to create all the web pages and
features that a blog normally has such as tagging, commenting, theming and
personalization. Since the default funciontalities of Gihub Pages are just too
basic for my taste, I needed something more. Luckily, Github Pages uses
and supports [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) under the hood to render Markdown
files into HTML files.
