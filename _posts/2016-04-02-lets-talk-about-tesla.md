# Sustainability is important

Yesterday, when the new Tesla Model 3 was unveil, an old idea about a
sustainable energy company came back to me. I remember when I was young, I
wanted to be in the sustainable energy business. I wanted to harvest the power
in the river and turn them into eletricity for the 
[city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City){:target="_blank"} that I
lived in. When I was a bit older, I knew that we can also harvest the same power
from the sun. 

The sun is even better because there is less harm to the
ecosystem. With that power, I also wanted to create fully electric public
transportation for the people in the rural areas to compute to the city. Above
all, I was fascinated by the fact that we can harvest endless power from nature
to improve our lives.

Now that I am 26, it turns out that things are not that easy. Reality teaches me
that for any business idea to work, there needs to be an economy behind for it
to operate. Often time, that economy contradicts with the ideaology where the
business was started with. I don't think Tesla is an exception. So I wanted to
understand if Tesla really is a company that pushes for sustainable energy
that it claims to be.

### Is Tesla using sustainable energy?

Well, Tesla cars are 100% electric. That, we all know, but I don't think 
all electricity is created equal. Some electricity is created from solar energy
and most is created using fossil fuel. At least, Tesla cars don't use fossil
fuel.  

I think there are several aspects that I need to examine to answer this question.
First, what kind of electricity is sustainable energy? and second, is the
infrastructure to support the level of Tesla's electricity consumption deemed
sustainable?

Just a disclaimer before I go into the detail. I don't have a Tesla car but I
would love to have one. Though, I don't  I will ever have one. I am not a
proponent or opponent of any party or organization. I am just a random person on
the Internet with a personal view.

Elon Musk himself has explained about this topic in a blog post
[here][blog_post]{:target="_blank"}. I would recommend you to read it if you
haven't already.

### Sustainable energy sources

Solar power is one of the most sustainable energy sources available today.
Perhaps, nuclear energy is better but the public doesn't like *nuclear* and it's a
entirely different topic. There are also hydroelectricity, wind power, tidal
power and a few more.  They are generally called *clean energy* or *renewable
energy*. 

However, the biggest source of electricity in the world is from burning
fossil fuel. Using fossil fuel to produce power is still the cheapest way to
make electricity. So unless most Tesla customers are paying higher price to use
clean engergy, the company's cars are not making much of a difference in terms of
burning less fossil fuel.

Musk also has admitted this in his [blog post][blog_post]{:target="_blank"}. He did though
brought up a good comparision of electric cars consuming indirect fossil fuels
via the power gird and the normal casrs that burns gasoline directly from the
combusion engine. The conclusion is that the combusion engine will produce more
C02 than electric cars. 

Another good argument that Musk has explained is that if you buy Tesla cars with
solar panels and you only drive less than, says, 50 miles a day, you could
become *energy possitive*. Meaning you produce more power than you actually
consume. 

While all of his arguments are very compeling, I think it misses a very
important factor which is the economy behind buying and using solar panels. The
sad fact is that solar based electricity is more expensive than using fossil
fuel ones. Not until the cost of operating and having solar panels is cheaper
than drawing electricity directly from the grid, the general public won't change
the way they consume electricity.

### Infrastructure for solar electric power
