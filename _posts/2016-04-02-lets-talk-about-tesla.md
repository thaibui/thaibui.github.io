# Sustainability is important

Yesterday, when the new Tesla Model 3 was unveiled, an old idea about a
sustainable energy company came back to me. I remember when I was young; I
wanted to be in the sustainable energy business. I wanted to harvest the power
of the river and turn it into electricity for the 
[city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City){:target="_blank"} that I
lived in. When I was a bit older, I knew that we could also harvest the same power
from the sun. 

Harvesting the sun is better because there is less harm to the
ecosystem. With that power, I also wanted to create fully electric public
transportation for the people in the rural areas to commute to the city. Above
all, I was fascinated by the fact that we can harvest endless power from nature
to improve our lives.

Now that I am 26, it turns out that things are not that easy. Reality teaches me
that for any business idea to work, there needs to be an economy behind for it
to operate. Often time, that economy contradicts with the ideology of the
original business. I don't think Tesla is an exception. So I wanted to understand if
Tesla really is a company that pushes for sustainable energy.

### Is Tesla using sustainable energy?

Well, Tesla cars are 100% electric. That, we all know, but I don't think 
all electricity is created equal. Some electricity is created from solar energy
and most is created using fossil fuel. At least, Tesla cars don't use fossil
fuel.  

I think there are several aspects that I need to examine to answer this question.
First, what kind of electricity is sustainable energy? And second, is the
infrastructure to support the level of Tesla's electricity consumption deemed
sustainable?

Just a disclaimer before I go into detail. I don't have a Tesla car but I
would love to have one. Though, I don't think I will ever have one. I am not a
proponent or opponent of any party or organization. I am just a random person on
the Internet with a personal view.

Elon Musk himself has talked about this topic in a blog post
[here][blog_post]{:target="_blank"}. I would recommend you to read it if you
haven't already.

### Sustainable energy sources

Solar power is one of the most sustainable energy sources available today.
Perhaps, nuclear energy is better but the public doesn't like *nuclear* and it's
an entirely different topic. There is also hydroelectricity, wind power, tidal
power and a few more sources. They are generally called *clean energy* or *renewable
energy* sources. 

However, the biggest source of electricity in the world comes from burning
fossil fuel. Using fossil fuel to produce power is still the cheapest way to
make electricity. So unless most Tesla customers are paying a higher price to use
clean energy, the company's cars are not making much of a difference in terms of
burning less fossil fuel.

Musk also has admitted this in his [blog post][blog_post]{:target="_blank"}.
Though, he did bring up a good comparison of electric cars consuming indirect
fossil fuels via the power grid and the normal cars that burn gasoline. The
conclusion is electric cars will produce less C02 than the regular combustion
engine ones. 

Another good argument that Musk has mentioned is that if you buy a Tesla car as
well as solar panels and you only drive less than says 50 miles a day,
you could become *energy positive*. Meaning you consume less power than you
actually produce via your solar panels. 

While all of his arguments are very compelling, I think they miss a very
important factor, which is the not-so-cheap-economy behind buying and having
renewable energy. The sad fact is that solar-based electricity is more expensive
than using fossil fuel ones and Ain't Nobody Got Money for more expensive utility.

### The infrastructure for Tesla cars

Tesla cars use Lithium-ion batteries and they use a ton of them. The battery is
not cheap as well. The cost of the battery is falling every year but it is nowhere
near the price/energy density ratio needed for it to be competitive with 
gasoline. One thing I know about batteries is that they are big, heavy, bulky
and ugly. They are usually expensive, their performance degrades over time and
they are difficult to be recycled. 

Tesla knows this and it is doing everything to make the battery better. It is
building the Gigafactory just for mass-producing batteries and driving down the
cost. It is making the battery less ugly by designing the sleek [Powerwall
product][powerwall]{:target="_blank"}. 

Tesla is betting its future on the battery, a future where battery could be the
source of *not-so-clean-energy*. While the energy stored in a battery could
come from a sustainable energy source, producing the battery itself isn't
necessarily clean. Lithium is a natural material like coal and it needs to be
mined. Mining is one of the worse ways to [destroy our environment]
[mining]{:target="_blank"}.

Mining destroys the forest, the ecosystem and the community closed to it.
Furthermore, the batteries don't just need lithium; they need other heavy metal
such as copper and aluminum. Processing these heavy metals take a lot of
energy, chemicals and water as well. 

Hell, we don't even know if we have enough lithium in the world for us to
mine to guarantee that future. One [calculation here][lithium_calculation]{:target="_blank"} 
has shown that adding up all the currently known lithium sources in the world
may not be enough to ascertain a future of *all* fully electric cars. Perhaps
SpaceX can help Tesla to find another planet with more lithium to mine.

On top of that, Tesla is building a network of charging stations across the
globe. It is doing so much it is burning more than $1 billion dollars in cash a
year while the company is still not making any money. I am no economist but that
pretty much tells me that at one point the company will have zero dollars to
spend.

The latest Model 3 is one of the hopes for the company to be profitable. I 
truly hope that the Model 3 will bring profitability to Tesla. If it
isn't, I don't think Tesla will ever be a sustainable business. When the
business can no longer sustain a positive cash flow, the original intent of
pushing for clean energy will slip away as well. You have to think about bread
and butter before you could care for the environment. Currently, the public
doesn't believe that and it explains why Tesla's stock is still high.

<h3 id="a-future-without-with-tesla">A future <s>without</s> with Tesla?</h3>

Honestly, I don't want a future without Tesla. It is such an innovative, 
forward-thinking company. It is the very idea of a company I wanted to 
build when I was young. I don't want to see it is not succeeding. If Tesla ever
fails, though, I think a company should pursue producing a very efficient
combustion engine car. At least, producing a very impressive hybrid beast with a
100-MPG rating.

I don't see a future where batteries could be packed into a rocket engine to fly
to space. Why is Tesla betting so much on a technology that doesn't have that much
potential? I think we need several more jumps in battery technology
breakthroughs in order for it to be viable for the future of mankind. I would
image the battery of the future to be as small as a car seat while delivering
enough juice to travel for weeks. The battery has to be light, safe, easy to
produce and to handle. Or at least, it must have the potential to do so. 

So far, the future seems a bit gloomy to me. There is so much more to talk
about and I believe I just have just scratched the surface of a tremendously 
difficult problem.
