# Sustainability is important

Yesterday, when the new Tesla Model 3 was unveil, an old idea about sustainable
energy company came back to me. I remember when I was young, I wanted to be in the
sustainable energy business. I wanted to harvest the power in the river and turn
them into eletricity for the [city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_City) 
that I lived in. When I was a bit older, I knew that we can also harvest the
same power from the sun. The sun is even better because there is less harm to the
ecosystem. With that power, I also wanted to create fully electric public
transportation for the people in the rural areas to compute to the city. Above
all, I was fascinated by the fact that we can harvest endless power from nature
as a source and use them to improve our lives.

Now that I am 26, it turns out that things are not that easy. Reality teaches me
that for any business idea to work, there needs to be an economy behind for it
to operate. Often time, that economy contradicts with the ideaology where the
business was started with. I don't think Tesla is an exception. So I wanted to
understand if Tesla really is a company that pushes for sustainable energy
that it claims to be.

### Is Tesla using sustainable energy?

Well, Tesla cars are 100% electric. That, we all know, but I don't think 
all electricity is created equal. Some electricity is created from solar energy
and most is created using fossil fuel. At least, Tesla cars don't use fossil fuel
which is totally unsustainable and harmful to the environment. I think there are
several things that I need to examine to answer the question. First, what kind
of electricity is sustainable energy, and second, is the infrastructure to
support the level of Tesla's electricity consumption sustainable.

Just a disclaimer before I go into the detail. I don't have a Tesla car and I
would love to have one. Though, I don't know if I will ever have one. I am not a
proponent or opponent of any party or organization. I am just a random person on
the Internet with a personal view.

### Sustainable energy sources

Solar power is one of the most sustainable energy sources and perhaps nuclear
energy as well (but the public doesn't like it and it's a entirely different
topic). There are also hydroelectricity, wind power, tidal power and a few more. 
Of course, the biggest source of electricity in the world is from burning fossil
fuel. Using fossil fuel to produce power is still the cheapest way to make
electricity. So unless Tesla is chaging that equation, the company is still not
using sustainable energy.

At least Tesla's cars are not burning fossil fuel, it helps reduce \\( CO_2 \\) consumption.
But how much will the entire world benefit from using only electric cars? And
where will the gas that the cars would normally consume be used for?

Given that if all cars are electric, there will be no market for gasoline. The
fossil fuel used to make gasoline will be used for something else. Could that
something else be the electricity that Tesla cars consume? At the end of the
day, if the economics of the fossil fuel could turn against all the hard work that
Tesla is striving for, where is the sustainability in a the Tesla model then.
